# CSE_145_237D_Smartfin
# We are developing a more robust data processing framework for accurately determining wave conditions from a surf session.
# The wave characteristics that we would like to calculate include: wave period and frequency, significant wave height, and wave direction. 
# We are also trying to develop a better way of visualizing the Smartfin's orientation for future work.
